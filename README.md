CONS 454 Final Project: Using SciKit-Learn to Explore Machine Learning Solutions for Camera Trap Data Classification

Ben McPhee 2025


First task: implement some baseline classification models on flattened images.
Setup: I hand-selected 100 training images and 50 validation images, with either animals, people, or nothing in them, and made these the 3 classes for images to be put into.
Findings: dummy model accuracy - 78%, logistic regression model accuracy - 100% training, 62% validation.
